          <materialAspects>Revenue that Robinhood Securities, LLC (“RHS”) receives from third-party market centers is shared with Robinhood Financial LLC (“RHF”) pursuant to a revenue and cost allocation agreement. RHS passes 80% of such revenue to RHF. The amounts above represent payments received by RHS. RHS receives payment from this venue for routing equity order flow to it. The payment varies based upon a fixed percentage of the spread between the National Best Bid and National Best Offer for the security at the time of order execution (12.35% of the spread during regular market hours and 9% of the spread during extended hours). The fixed percentage is the same for all non-exchange third-party market centers to which RHS routes equity order flow. RHS attests to the retail nature of the orders RHS routes to third-party market centers upon their request. Non-exchange third party market centers compete for orders based on execution quality. The SEC Examination Staff has observed that there is a potential tradeoff between (i) payments received by brokers and (ii) price improvement and/or execution quality. RHS believes that the receipt of payment in the form of a portion of the spread earned by non-exchange third party market centers does not interfere with RHS' pursuit of best execution or the price improvement obtained on customer orders.</materialAspects>

RHS attests to the retail nature of the orders RHS routes to third-party market centers upon their request. Non-exchange third party market centers compete for orders based on execution quality.  The SEC Examination Staff has observed that there is a potential tradeoff between (i) payments received by brokers and (ii) price improvement and/or execution quality.

          <materialAspects>Revenue that Robinhood Securities, LLC (“RHS”) receives from third-party market centers is shared with Robinhood Financial LLC (“RHF”) pursuant to a revenue and cost allocation agreement. RHS passes 80% of such revenue to RHF. The amounts above represent payments received by RHS. RHS receives payment from this venue for routing equity order flow to it. The payment varies based upon a fixed percentage of the spread between the National Best Bid and National Best Offer for the security at the time of order execution (12.35% of the spread during regular market hours and 9% of the spread during extended hours). The fixed percentage is the same for all non-exchange third-party market centers to which RHS routes equity order flow. RHS attests to the retail nature of the orders RHS routes to third-party market centers upon their request. Non-exchange third party market centers compete for orders based on execution quality.  The SEC Examination Staff has observed that there is a potential tradeoff between (i) payments received by brokers and (ii) price improvement and/or execution quality. RHS believes that the receipt of payment in the form of a portion of the spread earned by non-exchange third party market centers does not interfere with RHS' pursuit of best execution or the price improvement obtained on customer orders.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>Revenue that Robinhood Securities, LLC (“RHS”) receives from third-party market centers is shared with Robinhood Financial LLC (“RHF”) pursuant to a revenue and cost allocation agreement. RHS passes 80% of such revenue to RHF. The amounts above represent payments received by RHS. RHS receives payment from this venue for routing equity order flow to it. The payment varies based upon a fixed percentage of the spread between the National Best Bid and National Best Offer for the security at the time of order execution (12.35% of the spread during regular market hours and 9% of the spread during extended hours). The fixed percentage is the same for all non-exchange third-party market centers to which RHS routes equity order flow. RHS attests to the retail nature of the orders RHS routes to third-party market centers upon their request. Non-exchange third party market centers compete for orders based on execution quality. The SEC Examination Staff has observed that there is a potential tradeoff between (i) payments received by brokers and (ii) price improvement and/or execution quality. RHS believes that the receipt of payment in the form of a portion of the spread earned by non-exchange third party market centers does not interfere with RHS' pursuit of best execution or the price improvement obtained on customer orders.</materialAspects>

For multi-leg orders, RHS received a per contract rate of $.30, $.40, $.40, or $.50 for symbols assigned to one of four special buckets for symbols with relatively narrow average spreads, $.60 for other symbols that can be quoted and traded in minimum increments of $.01, and $.90 for all other symbols. Differences in average payments among venues are due to the mix of symbols executed at each venue. RHS attests to the retail nature of the orders RHS routes to third-party market centers upon their request. Non-exchange third party market centers compete for orders based on execution quality.  The SEC Examination Staff has observed that there is a potential tradeoff between (i) payments received by brokers and (ii) price improvement and/or execution quality. RHS believes that the receipt of payment in the form of a portion of the spread earned by non-exchange third party market centers does not interfere with RHS' pursuit of best execution or the price improvement obtained on customer orders.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>Revenue that Robinhood Securities, LLC (“RHS”) receives from third-party market centers is shared with Robinhood Financial LLC (“RHF”) pursuant to a revenue and cost allocation agreement. RHS passes 80% of such revenue to RHF.  The venues each pay Robinhood based on the same schedule. For single leg orders, RHS receives a per contract rate that depends on (1) the average closing VIX price over the preceding ten trading days as of the first of the month and (2) the average spread for the symbol traded. For multi-leg orders, RHS receives a per contract rate that depends on the average spread for the symbol traded. In December, for single leg orders, RHS received a per contract rate of $.30, $.375, $.475, or $.575 for symbols assigned to one of four special buckets for symbols with relatively narrow average spreads, $.725 for other symbols that can be quoted and traded in minimum increments of $.01, and $1.15 for all other symbols.
