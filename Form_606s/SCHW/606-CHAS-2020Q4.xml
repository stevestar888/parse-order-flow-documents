          <materialAspects>As detailed above, Charles Schwab receives payment for routing listed option order flow to market makers. Any difference in average net per contract payments paid by market makers is due to the various type of orders and respective quantities they handle. Schwab will not bid out its order flow among venues nor negotiate over rates of payment as a condition for sending more order flow to a market venue. Dash has agreements with unaffiliated market makers, designed to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities to Dash’s retail equity option clients.</materialAspects>
