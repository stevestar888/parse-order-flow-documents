          <materialAspects>Instinet is APEX's order routing technology provider and APEX also routes orders to Instinet brokerage services. All non-directed orders that APEX routed to Instinet were further routed to U.S. securities exchanges, alternative trading centers or single dealer platforms pursuant to Instinet’s order routing arrangements.  APEX paid Instinet a technology fee for its order routing provider services which included routes to brokers, and APEX also paid Instinet for exchange fees and ATS fees (as applicable) for orders that Instinet further routed to an exchange or an ATS and received an execution.  In certain instances, APEX paid Instinet a brokerage fee for other non-directed orders that resulted in execution on an exchange or ATS.  Brokerage fees paid by APEX to Instinet are based upon volume tiers.  Instinet rebated to APEX exchange fees and payment that it received from exchanges, ATS’ and single broker platforms.  In turn, APEX distributed the exchange rebates and other payments received to the applicable APEX client that sent such qualifying, non-directed orders resulting in execution.  https://www.instinet.com/order-disclosures</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>Instinet is APEX's order routing technology provider and APEX also routes orders to Instinet brokerage services. All non-directed orders that APEX routed to Instinet were further routed to U.S. securities exchanges, alternative trading centers or single dealer platforms pursuant to Instinet’s order routing arrangements.  APEX paid Instinet a technology fee for its order routing provider services which included routes to brokers, and APEX also paid Instinet for exchange fees and ATS fees (as applicable) for orders that Instinet further routed to an exchange or an ATS and received an execution.  In certain instances, APEX paid Instinet a brokerage fee for other non-directed orders that resulted in execution on an exchange or ATS.  Brokerage fees paid by APEX to Instinet are based upon volume tiers.  Instinet rebated to APEX exchange fees and payment that it received from exchanges, ATS’ and single broker platforms.  In turn, APEX distributed the exchange rebates and other payments received to the applicable APEX client that sent such qualifying, non-directed orders resulting in execution.  https://www.instinet.com/order-disclosures</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>Instinet is APEX's order routing technology provider and APEX also routes orders to Instinet brokerage services. All non-directed orders that APEX routed to Instinet were further routed to U.S. securities exchanges, alternative trading centers or single dealer platforms pursuant to Instinet’s order routing arrangements.  APEX paid Instinet a technology fee for its order routing provider services which included routes to brokers, and APEX also paid Instinet for exchange fees and ATS fees (as applicable) for orders that Instinet further routed to an exchange or an ATS and received an execution.  In certain instances, APEX paid Instinet a brokerage fee for other non-directed orders that resulted in execution on an exchange or ATS.

For complex orders in the penny interval program, the payment rate was between $.51-$.52 per contract.  For classes not in the penny interval program, the rate was $0.80 per contract.  
All option market makers that APEX routed options orders resulting in executions paid the same rates to APEX for orders in the same categories. These payments were not contingent upon volume-based tiered payment schedules, agreements regarding minimum order flow, incentives for exceeding order flow thresholds, disincentives for failing to meet order flow thresholds, nor trade-off’s of payment or other incentives/disincentives for price improvement or other execution quality.</materialAspects>
